"Cleo is a huge Great Dane aged 5. I got her from the pound in Tulsa, Oklahoma. She’s a little leash aggressive and crazy, but she loves dogs once she gets to know them. She lives with a bald cat, and we’re fostering a kitten right now, so she’s in complete mom play zone. She’s just a silly, goofy girl. ” @nathan.thenyweenie is the dog's account. this post has 1000 likes and 200 comments. www.instagram.com/jsdf79sdfjkk",
