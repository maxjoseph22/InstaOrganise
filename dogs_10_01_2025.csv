"Finn, mix, W 10th & W 4th St., New York, NY • “He’s literally the most fun dog ever. He just always loves having fun and he loves playing.” @finnthemixinnyc, a rescue via @heartsandbonesrescue",
"Winnie, Samoyed (5 m/o), New York, NY • “She’s a handful. She only cuddles on her terms.” @winnieofwestvillage",
"Zelda, Rhodesian Ridgeback/Boxer mix (3 y/o), E 20th & Park Ave. S, New York, NY • “She’s a rascal, but she’s wonderful. She loves all people, but not all dogs. She’s devoted to my husband – I think if she had to make a choice, she’d go with him. You can’t give her a toy, because it’s gone. We got her indestructible toys, but she didn’t like them because she couldn’t destroy them. We had a dog for 17 years, and she died during COVID. Six months later, I said, we gotta go back to North Shore. She does agility at this wonderful place called @zoomroom – she gets all her energy out.” A rescue via @animalleague",
"Roman, Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (5 y/o), E 20th & Park Ave. S, New York, NY • “He lays on me everywhere I go, and he’s very talkative. He’s my first dog. My wife’s family had Cavaliers and Golden Retrievers, and they had a dog named Romeo, so Roman is named after him. He’s the best dog – I can’t get over him. He’s like somebody to always be home to you. I think I need a podcast called ‘The Dogs of my Life.’” @romanthecav",
"Papaya, Pembroke Welsh Corgi (4 y/o), Madison Square Park, New York, NY • “She’s quiet at home – she doesn’t bark. One time we tried to cook for her, she just pooped the whole time. It was terrible. She has more Instagram followers than me.” @papayalife924",
"Wiggins, mix (6 y/o), Madison Square Park, New York, NY • “He’s 50% Pit Bull, 14% Lab, 15% Coonhound, 12% Husky, 5% Weimaraner and 5% Chow Chow. He’s very chatty. We got him when he was seven months old from @bideawee – he’s originally from Tennessee. He’s very, very clownish, and he’s snuggly. He’s very expressive. We love him so much.” @rigginsgriggins, a rescue via @bideawee",
"Luna, Cockapoo (9 y/o), Central Park, New York, NY • “She doesn’t like her outfit very much. The snow outfit is because she gets snowballs stuck on her. Squeaky ball is her life, and she’s really lazy. She also hates vegetables – she used to have fruits and vegetables in her kibble, and she would eject the vegetables from her mouth. Then when she realizes the good stuff is gone, she’ll go back and get them.” @lunathebearbear",
"Fiji, mix (8 y/o), E 20th & Park Ave. S, New York, NY • “I’m her walker. She’s very friendly to other dogs. She does not like bicycles – she doesn’t believe in them. One hit her once and she had a broken leg.”",
"Parker, Labrador Retriever mix (8 y/o), Broadway & E 20th St., New York, NY • “He’s a rescue from Kentucky. We were walking by Petco, and @muddypawsrescuenyc was there. He’s the sweetest – he loves cuddling, and he loves being cozy. It was one of the best decisions we ever made when we brought him into our home.” @parkerthelabpuppy, a rescue via @muddypawsrescuenyc",
"Jang, Jindo (2 y/o), W 19th & 7th Ave., New York, NY • “He’s a little anxious, but really sweet and very brave. He’s a rescue from Korea – he was locked up on a construction site there. We got him about a year ago, and we couldn’t walk him. We’ve spent many, many hours just sitting with him outside. We love having a companion who cares about us, and having something outside of yourself to care for. He loves parmesan cheese, so he might be Italian a little bit.” @jangthejindo, a rescue via @koreank9rescue",
