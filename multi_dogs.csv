"Nathan & Cleo, Dachshund & mix (5 m/o & 5 y/o), Tompkins Square Park, New York, NY • “He’s a scaredy cat. He’s named after Nathan’s Hot Dogs in Coney Island.”",
"Cleo is squirrel crazy. I got her from the pound in Tulsa, Oklahoma. She’s a little leash aggressive and crazy, but she loves dogs once she gets to know them. She lives with a bald cat, and we’re fostering a kitten right now, so she’s in complete mom play zone. She’s just a silly, goofy girl.” @nathan.thenyweenie",
"Sadie, mix (2 y/o), E 7th & 2nd Ave., New York, NY • “This is my girlfriend’s dog. We didn’t get her together, but I love this dog so much. I couldn’t imagine life without her. Having a dog together gives us something to think about outside of each other. She’s a rescue from Tennessee, and she was brought up here when she was three months old. She has to work on certain things that trigger her, like stairwells. She’s very expressive, and very catty and sassy.”",
"Buckley, mix (3 m/o), Washington Square Park, New York, NY • “I’m watching him for someone, so I don’t really know his backstory. I guess he’s primarily Rhodesian Ridgeback. He’s such a puppy still. My favorite thing about dogs is that they’re always in a good mood, and their temperament is always easy to be around. I had a Golden Retriever for like 14 years.” A rescue via @waldosrescue",
"Rowie, mix, St. Andrews Rd, Gladwyne, PA • “She was in the Chinese meat market. She was on her way to the slaughterhouse, and she got intercepted on a truck with, like, 200 other dogs by this organization called No Dogs Left Behind. She’s on a personal mission to eliminate all the rats in New York City – she has not caught one yet, but she’s gotten very close. She’s the chillest dog you’ve ever met, and she was potty trained in like, five days. She’s remarkably calm for all she’s been through. She exclusively goes to the bathroom in crosswalks – it’s inconvenient. I’ve met so many new people on the block who I never would’ve talked to, and it’s fun, I feel like I have an instant community. She’s definitely changed my life.” A rescue via nodogsleftbehind",
"Mushu, Xoloitzcuintli (1 y/o), E 3rd St. & Bowery, New York, NY • “She needs the sweater to stay warm.”",
"Dakota, German Shepherd/Belgian Malinois mix (4 y/o), Water & Main St., Brooklyn, NY • “We rescued her from West Virginia when she was six weeks old – they were found, no mom, just the siblings on the side of the road. She’s a very weird girl – she loves peeing on the grates. Only the grates. She’s our first dog together – we had also only been dating for two months at the time that we got her. She was our ring bearer at our wedding. She knows that all of the doormen give treats, so she will pull you to different buildings where she knows they give treats. She’s a great traveler – we love to hike, she loves to hike. She loves the backseat of a car, so she’s always down to go anywhere.” @dakotainthecity",
"PJ, Jindo (3 y/o), Water & Dock St., Brooklyn, NY • “His full name is Podjook – I just call him PJ. He’s very funny. I think a lot of people thought that he was really aggressive at first, but he just needs his space and time and boundaries. He’s really sweet once you get to know him. If I leave a glass of water on our small coffee table, he’ll take a swipe of it. I’ve been following @koreank9rescue for so many years, and I was like, if I ever get a dog, I’m gonna adopt, and it’s gonna be from them. We fostered him and had him for three days, and we foster failed. It was love at first sight.” @bbjindo_podjook, a rescue via @koreank9rescue",
"Ollie, Dachshund (11 m/o), Water & Old Fulton St., Brooklyn, NY • “He’s really kooky. He likes to steal all my socks and underwear, and he drags them under the bed. He eats anything, and he gets his zoomies at 12 AM. He likes to go in between all my furniture and under the ottoman, and then grabs his lamb toy he likes.” @ollie_the_little_ween",
"Piccola, Italian Greyhound (6 y/o), Water & Old Fulton St., Brooklyn, NY • “She doesn’t like mechanical things. She loves people, but doesn’t love other dogs. She will go up to anyone. I’ve never really wanted any other dog – I’ve always wanted an Italian Greyhound. Walking her is a good break from a work day – it’s a clear transition every single day. She’s very loving and very affectionate.” @piccola_ruffo_gomes_ny",
"Stella & Gru, French Bulldog & French Bulldog/Boston Terrier mix, Columbia Heights & Clark St., Brooklyn, NY • “He’s named after Gru from ‘Despicable Me.’ Stella’s the one in charge. Gru is freaked out by weird noises and things that are new to him. He’s always interested in things that are out of place – if there’s a package in our lobby that he’s never seen before, he’ll rush around it. Frenchies are always happy and excited to play. They may seem chunky and you’d think they’re a little lazy, but they have a lot of energy. I love how dogs keep you company, and whenever you wanna take a walk, you take them out with you. It’s pretty enjoyable.”",
