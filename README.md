Welcome to my 2025 project!

My current focus on backend development is exemplified by my ongoing project: building a web application that processes and organises Instagram data at scale. Using Python and SQL, I am creating a system that scrapes large volumes of posts, processes them through an AI API, and stores the structured data in a SQL database. This allows for Instagram users to better utilise their content, with search and sorting capabilities on Instagram itself sorely lacking. I am strengthening my backend engineering capabilities through independent research and self-led learning as well as collaboration with a mentor and other members of my Makers cohort.
